# Alan_Healthcare_App
Uses Alan to access and create patients

Creates voice recognition scripts within Javascript, using the Alan SDK to retrieve data from the user. 
The Swift files construct a basic application that can be accessed by doctors without the usage of voice recognition,
but it also allows for a conjunction between the Javascript files and Swift files, so you can integrate voice recongition within your app.
